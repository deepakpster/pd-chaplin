# Optimising initial load speed in Chaplin collection view.

## Installation
Clone this repo manually with git or use `brunch new gh:deepakpster/pd-chaplin`

## Getting started
* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * [Bower](http://bower.io): `npm install -g bower`
    * Brunch plugins and Bower dependencies: `npm install & bower install`
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production
* Instruction:
		* Open console log to see the data load.
		* `http://localhost:3333/collection` - Normal implementation of collection view where the view is blocked till the last iteration of data.
		* `http://localhost:3333/performance` - Optimised implementation of collection view where the view is unblocked and rows are added to the collection view one at a time.
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
